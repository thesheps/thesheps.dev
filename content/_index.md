# Hallo, I'm Sheps! &#128075;

I'm a software engineer based near Manchester, UK. I like [speaking at conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_DBFHWn3YE), [writing the occasional article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/building-infrastructure-platform.html) and have spent the last 15 or so years bouncing around tech organisations learning how [not] to write software!

I'm going to be using this site as a means to talk about my own personal journey through tech, as well as to promote any fun projects I might be working with. It'll probably be a fair mix of tech, personal and whisky related stuff.

If you'd like to get in touch you can contact me on any of the socials over there &#128073;
